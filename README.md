- 👋 Hi, I’m @trevortomesh — Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–River Falls.
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber ethics, computational theology, modeling and simulation, programming languages, and educational technology (especially AI-assisted teaching).
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring sacred computing, Docker-based CS education, and thing-oriented programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research related to AI ethics, faith and technology, or creative computer science education. Email me!
