- 👋 Hi, I’m @trevortomesh — Assistant Professor of Computer Science.
- ✝️ Unapologetically Catholic. Unapologetically Conservative.
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber ethics, computational theology, modeling and simulation, programming languages, and educational technology (especially AI-assisted teaching).
- 🌱 Currently building sacred tech projects, refining Docker-based CS curricula, and developing thing-oriented programming.
- 💞️ Always open to bold research collaborations—especially those that push back against modern nihilism and moral relativism in tech. Email me.
